# Navigation & Authentication Bug Report

## Overview

This document identifies critical user experience bugs related to navigation, authentication, and photo upload functionality in the marketplace application. These issues significantly impact user onboarding and core marketplace functionality.

## Bug #1: Sign-In Popup Disappears Immediately

### **Priority**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Blocks user authentication

### Symptoms
- User clicks "Sign In" button in the navigation header
- Authentication modal appears briefly (< 1 second)
- Modal immediately closes without user interaction
- User cannot complete sign-in process

### Root Cause Analysis
**Location**: `apps/web/components/home/HomePage.tsx:191-200`

**Issue**: Race condition in authentication state management and component re-rendering

```tsx
if (currentView === 'auth') {
  return (
    <EnhancedAuth
      isOpen={true}
      onClose={handleBackToHome}  // ← This may be called immediately
      onAuthSuccess={handleAuthSuccess}
      initialMode={authMode}
    />
  )
}
```

**Contributing Factors**:
1. **useAuth Hook Timing**: The `useAuth` hook in `HomePage.tsx:30-32` may trigger immediate re-renders
2. **Auth State Changes**: Supabase auth state listener in `useAuth.ts:79-81` causes rapid state updates
3. **Component Mounting**: Authentication modal remounts frequently due to parent state changes

### Impact
- **User Experience**: Users cannot sign in, blocking marketplace access
- **Conversion Rate**: New users abandon the site due to broken authentication
- **Business Impact**: Complete loss of user acquisition

### Technical Details
**Files Affected**:
- `apps/web/components/home/HomePage.tsx:191-200` (Auth modal rendering)
- `apps/web/lib/hooks/useAuth.ts:23-46` (Debounced auth state changes)
- `apps/web/components/auth/enhanced-auth.tsx:306` (Modal visibility logic)

## Bug #2: Photo Upload Popup Disappears During Listing Creation

### **Priority**: 🟠 **HIGH** - Blocks core marketplace functionality

### Symptoms
- User clicks "Create Your Listing" button on home page
- File picker opens correctly
- After selecting photos, processing begins
- Upload/analysis popup appears briefly then disappears
- User cannot complete listing creation

### Root Cause Analysis
**Location**: `apps/web/components/home/HeroSection.tsx:71-89`

**Issue**: File upload flow conflicts with component state management

```tsx
const handleCreateListingClick = () => {
  // Creates temporary input element
  const input = document.createElement('input')
  input.onchange = async (e) => {
    const files = Array.from((e.target as HTMLInputElement).files || [])
    if (files.length > 0) {
      handleFilesDirectly(files)  // ← This triggers useFileUpload
    }
    document.body.removeChild(input)  // ← Input removed immediately
  }
}
```

**Contributing Factors**:
1. **useFileUpload Hook**: `useFileUpload.ts:14-109` manages complex async state
2. **Preview State Management**: `HomePage.tsx:153-156` state transitions conflict
3. **Navigation Interference**: Authentication checks during upload process

### Impact
- **User Experience**: Users cannot create listings, core functionality broken
- **Business Impact**: Sellers cannot add inventory to marketplace
- **Revenue**: Direct impact on marketplace transaction volume

### Technical Details
**Files Affected**:
- `apps/web/components/home/HeroSection.tsx:71-89` (Upload initiation)
- `apps/web/lib/hooks/useFileUpload.ts:54-100` (Upload processing)
- `apps/web/components/home/HomePage.tsx:153-156` (Preview state)

## Bug #3: "Sell" Button Navigation Loop

### **Priority**: 🟠 **HIGH** - Confusing user experience

### Symptoms
- User clicks "Sell" button from any page except home page
- Instead of navigating to listing creation, redirects to sign-in
- After authentication, user lands on home page instead of listing creation
- Creates confusion about how to start selling process

### Root Cause Analysis
**Location**: Multiple navigation handlers across pages

**Issue**: Inconsistent "Sell" button behavior and authentication flow

**Browse Page** (`apps/web/app/browse/page.tsx:16-18`):
```tsx
const handleCreateListing = () => {
  router.push('/')  // ← Always goes to home, no auth check
}
```

**Navigation Component** (`apps/web/components/navigation/MainNavigation.tsx:95-98`):
```tsx
{currentPage !== 'home' && onCreateListing && (
  <Button variant="ghost" size="sm" onClick={onCreateListing}>
    Sell  // ← Behavior depends on page implementation
  </Button>
)}
```

**Contributing Factors**:
1. **Inconsistent Auth Flow**: Different pages handle "Sell" button differently
2. **Missing Context**: No way to preserve "intent to sell" across authentication
3. **Navigation Logic**: Each page implements its own selling navigation

### Impact
- **User Experience**: Confusing multi-step process to start selling
- **Conversion**: Sellers abandon listing creation due to navigation issues
- **Consistency**: Inconsistent behavior across application pages

### Technical Details
**Files Affected**:
- `apps/web/app/browse/page.tsx:16-18` (Browse page sell handler)
- `apps/web/components/navigation/MainNavigation.tsx:95-98` (Sell button)
- `apps/web/components/home/HomePage.tsx:42-49` (Home page auth flow)

## Recommended Solutions

### Bug #1: Sign-In Popup Fix
**Priority**: Immediate

1. **Stabilize Auth State**: Add proper loading states and debouncing
2. **Prevent Race Conditions**: Use `useRef` to track modal state
3. **Component Isolation**: Move auth modal outside main component tree

```tsx
// Recommended approach
const [authModalOpen, setAuthModalOpen] = useState(false)
const authModalRef = useRef<boolean>(false)

useEffect(() => {
  authModalRef.current = authModalOpen
}, [authModalOpen])
```

### Bug #2: Photo Upload Fix  
**Priority**: Immediate

1. **State Management**: Prevent component unmounting during upload
2. **Progress Persistence**: Maintain upload state across re-renders
3. **Error Handling**: Add proper upload failure recovery

```tsx
// Recommended approach
const uploadStateRef = useRef<'idle' | 'uploading' | 'processing'>('idle')
```

### Bug #3: Consistent Sell Navigation
**Priority**: Medium

1. **Unified Navigation**: Create single sell button handler
2. **Context Preservation**: Store "sell intent" in localStorage
3. **Auth Flow**: Redirect to listing creation after authentication

```tsx
// Recommended approach
const handleSellClick = () => {
  if (!user) {
    localStorage.setItem('pendingAction', 'create-listing')
    setAuthMode('signin')
    setCurrentView('auth')
  } else {
    // Direct to listing creation
  }
}
```

- [ ] Click "Sell" from browse page → Proper navigation flow
- [ ] Sign in and verify redirect to intended destination
- [ ] Test on multiple browsers and devices

### Automated Testing
- [ ] Add E2E tests for authentication flow
- [ ] Test file upload process end-to-end
- [ ] Verify navigation consistency across pages
