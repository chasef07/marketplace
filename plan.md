## 📋 Phase 1: Quick Wins (Week 1 - Days 1-2)

### Priority: High | Risk: Low | Impact: High

#### 1.1 Dead Code Removal
**File**: `apps/web/components/home/HomePage.tsx`
- [ ] Remove line 39: `const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null)`
- [ ] Remove line 234: `const handleItemClick = useCallback(...)`
- [ ] Remove lines 268-276: Commented profile handlers
- [ ] Remove unused ProfileEdit dynamic import

**Estimated Reduction**: 15 lines

#### 1.2 Type Safety Fixes  
**Files**: `HomePage.tsx`, `HeroSection.tsx`, `ListingPreview.tsx`
- [ ] Replace unsafe `(analysisData.analysis as any)` with `analysisData.analysis?.`
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate User interface definitions
- [ ] Import `User` from `@/lib/types/user` in all components

**Files to Update**:
- [ ] Remove User interface from `HeroSection.tsx:10-19`
- [ ] Remove User interface from `ListingPreview.tsx:15-24`
- [ ] Remove User interface from `enhanced-auth.tsx:9-18`
- [ ] Add import: `import { User } from "@/lib/types/user"`

**Estimated Reduction**: 30 lines across 3 files

---

## 🏗️ Phase 2: Component Restructuring (Week 1-2)

### Priority: High | Risk: Medium | Impact: Very High

#### 2.1 Extract Shared Upload Logic (Days 3-5)
**Create**: `apps/web/lib/hooks/useFileUpload.ts`

**New Hook Structure**:
```typescript
export function useFileUpload() {
  const uploadAndAnalyze = useCallback(async (files: File[]) => {
    // Consolidated logic from HeroSection and InteractiveUploadZone
  }, [])
  
  return { 
    uploadAndAnalyze, 
    isAnalyzing, 
    progress,
    error 
  }
}
```

**Components to Update**:
- [ ] `HeroSection.tsx` - Replace lines 41-90 with hook
- [ ] `InteractiveUploadZone.tsx` - Replace lines 40-121 with hook
- [ ] Remove duplicate drag & drop handlers

**Estimated Reduction**: 130 lines of duplicate logic

#### 2.2 Split HomePage Component (Week 2 - Days 1-3)
**Current**: 364-line monolithic component  
**Target**: 3 focused components

**New Structure**:
- [ ] `HomePage.tsx` (150 lines) - Main orchestration
- [ ] `HomeAuth.tsx` (100 lines) - Auth state management  
- [ ] `HomeRouter.tsx` (80 lines) - View routing logic

**Benefits**:
- Single Responsibility Principle compliance
- Easier unit testing
- Better maintainability

#### 2.3 Consolidate Upload Components (Days 4-5)
- [ ] Extract reusable `UploadZone` component
- [ ] Update `HeroSection` to use shared component
- [ ] Evaluate `InteractiveUploadZone` for removal

**Estimated Reduction**: 150 lines

---

## ⚡ Phase 3: Performance Optimization (Week 3 - Days 1-3)

### Priority: Medium | Risk: Low | Impact: Medium

#### 3.1 React Performance Patterns
**Components to Optimize**:
- [ ] Add `React.memo` to `HomePage`, `HeroSection`, `ListingPreview`
- [ ] Implement `useCallback` for expensive operations
- [ ] Add `useMemo` for computed values

**Example Implementation**:
```typescript
const HomePage = React.memo(function HomePage() {
  const memoizedAuthCallback = useCallback((userData: User) => {
    // Auth logic
  }, [])
  // ...
})
```

#### 3.2 State Management Optimization
- [ ] Replace 7 `useState` calls with `useReducer` for complex state
- [ ] Consolidate `currentView`, `selectedItemId`, `selectedUsername`, `previewData`

**New Structure**:
```typescript
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(homePageReducer, initialState)
```

#### 3.3 Bundle Size Optimization
- [ ] Remove unused dynamic imports (ProfileEdit)
- [ ] Optimize remaining dynamic imports
- [ ] Analyze bundle impact with `npm run build:analyze`

**Expected Bundle Reduction**: 15-20%

---

## 🧹 Phase 4: File Cleanup (Week 3 - Days 4-5)

### Priority: Low | Risk: High | Impact: Medium

#### 4.1 Component Removal Assessment
**Candidate**: `InteractiveUploadZone.tsx` (282 lines)
- [ ] Verify functionality overlap with HeroSection
- [ ] Create replacement using shared UploadZone
- [ ] **TESTING REQUIRED**: Full upload workflow validation
- [ ] **ROLLBACK PLAN**: Keep original file until replacement validated

#### 4.2 Minor Optimizations
- [ ] Inline `ThemedLoading.tsx` if under 50 lines
- [ ] Remove unused variables in `ListingPreview.tsx`
- [ ] Clean up inline styles in `ListingPreview.tsx:103-112`

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Pre-Implementation
- [ ] Create feature branch: `optimize/homepage-architecture`
- [ ] Document current functionality with screenshots
- [ ] Run baseline performance measurements

### During Implementation
- [ ] Unit tests for shared hooks
- [ ] Component-level testing after each split
- [ ] Integration testing for auth flow

### Post-Implementation
- [ ] Manual testing: Upload → Preview → Create listing workflow
- [ ] Performance testing: Bundle size analysis
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Rollback validation
