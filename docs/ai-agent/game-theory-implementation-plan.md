  buyer_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  category TEXT,
  avg_response_time INTEGER,
  price_sensitivity DECIMAL(3,2),
  negotiation_style TEXT,
  success_rate DECIMAL(3,2),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Market conditions tracking
CREATE TABLE market_conditions (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,

## Game Theory Models

### 1. First-Price Sealed-Bid Auction Model
```typescript
interface AuctionModel {
  bidders: Bidder[];
  reservePrice: number;
  valuationDistribution: ProbabilityDistribution;
  equilibriumStrategy: BiddingStrategy;
}

interface Bidder {
  id: string;
  trueValuation: number;
  bidHistory: Bid[];
  behaviorProfile: BuyerBehaviorProfile;
}
```

### 2. Bayesian Inference Framework
```typescript
interface BayesianEstimator {
  priorDistribution: ProbabilityDistribution;
  likelihoodFunction: (observation: Offer) => number;
  posteriorDistribution: ProbabilityDistribution;
  updateBeliefs: (newOffer: Offer) => void;
}
```

### 3. Decision Theory Components
```typescript
interface DecisionProblem {
  actions: Action[]; // accept, reject, counter
  states: MarketState[];
  utilities: UtilityFunction;
  probabilities: BeliefState;
}
```
